For the steering/braking use diagram, we explore the misuse case where a malicious hijacker is attempting to take control of the vehicle away from the openpilot software. To start off, the hijacker will need to be able access the connection between the openpilot software and the vehicle CAN network where actuators are controlled. Since the openpilot software only uses Wi-Fi to connect to the car, this helps to limit the range from which someone could attempt to connect. Unfortunately, this doesnâ€™t help to prevent someone who is driving nearby and remaining within range. Therefore, another layer of protection via SSH IP filtering is implemented to make it harder for an unauthorized user to determine what the SSH key of the device running the openpilot software is.

Should the hijacker manage to get a working connection, however, there should be preemptive counters within the openpilot software to mitigate any further misuses. Due to the nature of openpilot being a critical system, having an environment which allows for code execution is not acceptable. As a result, much of the development effort has been put towards preventing this altogether rather than trying to sandbox everything. Even if a hijacker was able to execute code giving them remote control of the vehicle, the openpilot software has been developed to always allow for the driver to retake control immediately. The software also cannot alter the vehicle trajectory in a way which would be too quick for the driver to react safely in these cases.

## Part 2: OSS Project Documentation Review

### Security-Related configuration and installation issues

Openpilot software is a powerful tool that has many failsafes in place in order to prevent sudden failure of systems. For example, there are driver awareness sensors to ensure that the driver is actively paying attention and ready to regain control at all times, there is a fast and easy way to retake control over the vehicle, and there is an automatic shut-down feature for the self-driving software in case the sensors fail, or a major component of the software is performing unexpectedly. Below is a diagram illustrating all of the fail-safe features:

A major issue involving the security of this software is that it is operating "under good faith." Therefore, there are very few (if any) features dedicated to preventing malicious use of the software. If the software is hacked into or otherwise tampered with there is not much stopping the user since the software is made "under good faith." 

However, the software does do a fantastic job of quickly and safely controlling the vehicle and ensuring that the vehicle can safely pass control back to the operator of the vehicle. According to their website located at: https://comma-ai.medium.com/understanding-the-openpilot-safety-model-fe9797e306bf their safety model is based on three principles:

1. Driver must be actively paying attention
2. Driver must be capable of immediately retaking control
3. Vehicle must not alter too quickly for the driver to safely react
