# Code Analysis for Software Security Engineering
## Code Review Strategy
OpenPilot contains 1,886 files, and roughly half of them are python scripts. The rest of the files consist of a combination of bash and C, C++ files. While the use of an automated tool was within the realm of possibility, our team felt it was necessary to first try and scan the bulk of code using an automated scanner. It is worth mentioning that OpenPilot is a massively popular project meaning that our chances of finding active vulnerabilities may be slim. However, we wanted to give an automated scanner a try to test the waters and get a feel for the vulnerabilities we should expect to see. 


Jose and Jack both have experience using SonarCloud and felt it was the best option in going forth to scan the Python code first. We first forked the OpenPilot repository, added a `build.yml` plugin to our builds, and developed a `sonar-project.properties` with some minor changes to fit our scan criteria. To be able to compile the python code, we needed our 'sonar-project.properties' file to ignore all forms of C code to run properly. We did so be adding the lines `sonar.c.file.suffixes=-` , `sonar.cpp.file.suffixes=-`, and `sonar.objc.file.suffixes=-`. This netted us with 7 bugs and 182 vulnerabilities to manually check over. While we believe there are a number of false positives, our team is satisfied with the results returned, but this needed to be changed in order to run the scan and have it pick up the C code as well. 

In order for SonarCloud to correctly analyze C/C++/Objective-C code it needs to know the configurations that are used to build the code. In order to achieve this a development environment needs to be setup, OpenPilot provides instructions on how to do this and can be found [here](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/tools). The development environment was setup on a machine running Ubuntu 20.04 since this is what OpenPilot is developed on. Once the development environment was setup `sonar-scanner` and `build-wrapper-linux-x86-64` had to also be installed. Next `build-wrapper-linux-x86-64` needs to be ran with the command that builds the C code in our case that command looks like `build-wrapper-linux-x86-64 --out-dir buid_out scons -j$(nproc)`, the `scons -j$(nproc)` is the command that builds out all of the C code in the project. The `build-wrapper-linux-x86-64` creates a two files in the `out-dir`, a log file and a json file, these are the files needed in order to complete the analysis. Then this entry, `sonar.cfamily.build-wrapper-output=buid_out`, needs to be added to the `sonar-properties` file for `sonar-scanner` to know where to find the files generated by the build wrapper. lastly the `sonar-scanner` command is ran in order to get the analysis results.

In exploring how to analyze the C code of OpenPilot, we had also found success using Visual Code Grepper (VCG). Since Visual Code Grepper performs a static code analysis, it didnâ€™t require for the C files to be compiled before carrying out a scan. For this analysis tool, we downloaded the 0.8.10 release build of OpenPilot and VCG version 2.2.0. Once installed, the GUI of VCG allowed us to select the target directory where the Openpilot-0.8.10 root folder was located locally on the machine, perform a full scan on it, and export the table summarizing its findings as a csv file.



## Findings From Code Review
SonarCloud Scan Results: https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=Rafterman29_openpilot

## 

### CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

#### athnad.py
` if r.status_code == 302 and r.headers['Location'].startswith("http://u.web2go.com"):` 

#### helpers.py
`requests.put(f'http://{host}:{port}/qlog.bz2', data='')` and ` return func(*args, f'http://{host}:{port}', **kwargs)` 

In our automated scan of python scripts through SonarCloud, one concerning result returned was the use of mapped `http` addresses. This corresponds to CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. Our results suggested use to ask whether our application data transits over a network that is considered untrusted, and whether
compliance rules require the service to encrypt data in transit. Both of which we answered yes to. We recommend mapping these return functions to `https` addresses to mitigate sensitive information being transmitted through insecure channels.

### CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html

Code Review Source:
* https://sonarcloud.io/project/security_hotspots?id=Rafterman29_openpilot&hotspots=AX0lk528EafnvRiIF-LK#

```
    if input(msg) == 'y':
        print("Downloading {}".format(url))
        with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response, open(tera_path, 'wb') as out_file:
            shutil.copyfileobj(response, out_file)
        print("Successfully downloaded t_renderer.")
        os.chmod(tera_path, 0o755)
        return tera_path
    msg_cancel = "\nYou cancelled automatic download.\n\n"
    msg_cancel += manual_install
    msg_cancel += "Once installed re-run your script.\n\n"
```
 
This CWE states that " The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors." This risk was identified as a possibility within the `utils.py` file located in `\pyextra\acados_template`. On line 181 chmod is used to assign file read/write/execute permissions to user groups, and secure coding practices specify that the most restrictive permissions possible should be assigned to files and directories. Assigning less restrictive permissions can lead to unintended access to critical resource files. To mitigate the risk, SonarCloud recommended configuring the chmod to mask for file owner permissions.

We determined that this identified risk was relatively acceptable within OpenPilot, given where the risk was identified and its implementation. The resource file in question is a tera renderer utility which lets anybody read and execute the file, but only allows for the owner to write to it. Since the file will be running in a context which is neither a multi-user environment nor does it contain any confidential  information, it is acceptable for everyone to read it.

### CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html

Code Review Source:
* https://sonarcloud.io/project/security_hotspots?id=Rafterman29_openpilot&hotspots=AX0_TGjHgvHzTIyGNH5H

```
QString adapter;  // Path to network manager wifi-device
  QDBusConnection bus = QDBusConnection::systemBus();
  unsigned int raw_adapter_state;  // Connection status https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/1.26/nm-dbus-types.html#NMDeviceState
  QString connecting_to_network;
  QString tethering_ssid;
  const QString defaultTetheringPassword = "swagswagcomma";
  ```
  
 The use of a hard-code password could lead to a high risk of authentication failure within the system. This vulnerability was security issue was detected within  `selfdrive/ui/qt/offroad/wifiManager.h`. OpenPilot software is risk of credential leakage since this source is used within the production environment. Leakage or altering of these credentials could further lead the end user to have sensitive information leaked to the API service. Removal of the hard-coded password is strongly recommended.

### CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html

  const int part_size = content_length / parts;
  for (int i = 0; i < parts; ++i) {
    CURL *eh = curl_easy_init();
```

The automated scanner detected these code snippets within `selfdrive/ui/replay/util.cc` due to an inadequate TLS version being used. It is recommended to enforce TLS 1.2 as the minimum protocol version and disallow versions like TLS 1.0. Failure in doing so could open the door to downgrade attacks where a malicious actor who is able to intercept the connection could modify the requested protocol version and downgrade it to a less secure version.

## 

### CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html

Code Review Source:
* https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?cwe=119&directories=selfdrive/boardd&id=Rafterman29_openpilot&open=AX0_THL8gvHzTIyGNIWv&resolved=false&severities=BLOCKER&types=BUG

```
memcpy(&chunk[tail_size], &data[i+1], chunk_len);
```
```
memcpy(tail, &chunk[pos], tail_size);
```

The automated scanner detected these code snippets within `selfdrive/boardd/panda.cc` due to a memory copying function, `memcpy` overflowing the destination buffer. It is recommended that memory should be explicitly bound. Failure in doing so could open the door to a malicious actor cause a buffer overflow attack where they could then read memory, execute arbitrary code, or even perform a denial of service attack

## 

### CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/401.html

          if (params.get("NavDestination").empty()) {
            qWarning() << "Setting NavDestination from /next" << resp;
            params.put("NavDestination", resp.toStdString());
          } else {
            qWarning() << "Got location from /next, but NavDestination already set";
          }
          // Send DELETE to clear destination server side
          deleter->sendRequest(url, HttpRequest::Method::DELETE);
        }
      });

      background-color: #333333;
    }
  )").arg(key_spacing_vertical / 2).arg(key_spacing_horizontal / 2));
}
```

The automated scanner detected these code snippets within `selfdrive/ui/qt/maps/map_settings.cc` and `selfdrive/ui/qt/widgets/keyboard.cc` due to memory not being released after it is no longer in use. It is recommended that memory is allocated and freed within the same function. Failure in doing so could open the door to a malicious actor to trigger a memory leak and launch a denial of service attack.

### CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html

Code Review Source:

#### athnad.py
`  upload_id = hashlib.sha1(str(item).encode()).hexdigest()` 

In our automated scan of python scripts through SonarCloud, one concerning result returned was the use of the `sha1 algorithm` to hash the data. It corresponds to CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. `SHA-1` is no longer considered secure, and we can calculate the hash value with little computational effort. We recommend using `SHA-256` to hash the value. 

## 

### CWE-283: Unverified Ownership
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/283.html

Code Review Source:
* https://sonarcloud.io/project/security_hotspots?id=Rafterman29_openpilot&hotspots=AX0lk5gtEafnvRiIF96c

#### process.py
`   os.kill(self.proc.pid, sig)` 

In our automated scan of python scripts through SonarCloud, one result returned was the use of the 'os.kill'. SonarClooud considers this sensitive adn suggests checking user permissions and securing the source before sending the command to kill the process. For example, the signal could be sent via a world-writable file.

## 

### CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html

Code Review Source:
* https://sonarcloud.io/project/security_hotspots?id=Rafterman29_openpilot&hotspots=AX0_TGU2gvHzTIyGNHZS

#### fontstash.h
`   strncpy(font->name, name, sizeof(font->name));` 

In our automated scan of python scripts through SonarCloud, one result returned was the use of the 'strncpy'.The function `char *strncpy(char * restrict dest, const char * restrict src, size_t count);` copies the first count characters from src to dest, stopping at the first `null` character, and filling extra space with `0`. The wcsncpy does the same for wide characters and should be used with the same guidelines.The function, `strncpy` was designed to work with fixed-length strings and might result in a non-null-terminated string. Problems may arise given the possibility that either the source or the destination pointer is null, or if there is an overlap between the source and the destination.

## Summary of Key Findings
Based on the results above, our team has picked five major CWEs that need to be addressed to improve the overall security of OpenPilot. 

### CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html

This weakness is a very simple fix and allows for a significantly more secure system. 'https' addresses have built in security functionality that will help to mitigate sensitive data being accessed without authorization. Furthermore, the more complex the software becomes the more times these 'http' addresses will be referenced. Therefore, it is more secure to simply replace all 'http' references with 'https' references.

### CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html

Having a hard-coded password can lead to extremely damaging sensitive data leaks. By having access to these hard-coded passwords it would be very simple for an unauthorized user to be able to modify or retrieve sensitive user data. This can be easily fixed by either encrypting the password or outright removing it from the code. In order to further improved security measurements, Two-Factor Authentication and encryption are two examples of some fixes that could be applied to this sensitivity in order to remove the hard-coded password and improve the overall security of the system.
 
### CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html

As described in the previous sensitivity, encryption is incredibly important for maintaining security. However, simply having encryption is not enough and having easy to decrypt encryption is essentially the same as having no encryption when it comes to sensitive information like passwords. Therefore, although it may be difficult, a more complex encryption process should be utilized such as enforcing TLS 1.2 and disallowing TLS 1.0.

### CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html

Related to the previous sensitivity, an outdated or "solved" hashing algorithm is extremely dangerous because if someone was to become aware that this software is using this outdated (or "solved") 'sha1 algorithm' then it'll be very simple for them to obtain the raw data as an unauthorized user. It is recommended to upgrade to 'SHA-256' instead of 'SHA-1' to hash the value. This is a relatively simple change with extremely helpful security changes.

### CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/401.html

Finally, the OpenPilot code has multiple instances in which memory is not being released after it is no longer being used. Memory needs to be allocated and freed within the same function, however, many instances fail to do this. As a result, a malicious actor can bypass security through buffer overflows, memory leaks, denial of service attacks, and more. Although it is not quick to make this change, it is simple and once all memory has been properly allocated and freed then most of these possible memory leaks will be prevented.

Overall, most of the code for this system is written in C and C++ so most of the vulnerabilities outlined are general vulnerabilities that are common for these two languages (e.g. memory leaks and outdated functions). The system is overall very secure and any vulnerabilities, for the most part, are not extremely concerning. However, there should be an overhaul of the code in order to update and outdated/deprecated functions that are being utilized and general coding practices with C should be more rigidly maintained. Beyond this, many of the bugs that are SonarCloud automated review found were of little to no concern. Other than the major vulnerabilities listed above, many of these involved small issues that are more grammatical than anything (such as a break statement not being executed or a value initially being undefined).

Finally, there is one major issue in regard to security and that is how the python scripts are approached. In our automated scan we found 86 possible Command Injection vulnerabilities and 51 possible Weak Cryptography vulnerabilities and most of them were found within the python scripts for this system. This is due to arbitrary calls to the OS class in python which opens up a new shell prompt which has the possibility of leading to a command injection. Since there are so many instances of this occurring there should be a large code review in order to ensure that if these operating system calls are needed that they are secure and cannot be interrupted by an outside, unauthorized instance.

## Ongoing and Future Contributions to OpenPilot
Our team felt the way in which OpenPilot allows users to submit contributions was abit unique and felt the process needed some explanation. For reference, the document OpenPilot requests users to follow can be found [here](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/7746130a1e68ea2b8b0c781effb344f1edb207bc/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). OpenPilot first requests users to join there [Discord](https://discord.comma.ai/). From here, the `bug-report` channel contains a process from a user to follow before submitting a bug. For the sake of submitting coding errors after our analysis, we settled to report our findings via the [issue page](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/issues). Since it would take much longer than the remaining weeks to completely resolve the vulnerabilities we have found we decided to share our results in the previously mentioned issue page where we linked our SonarCloud scan. This is in hopes that others will be able to update the code in our stead in the future. Otherwise, if any of us have the time in the future beyond this semester we may contribute these changes ourselves.

Issue contributed can be found [here](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/issues/23026).

## Teamwork Reflection
Our first priority when it came to starting this assignment was finishing the weekly quiz as early as possible. This set us up for two meetings (11/18 & 11/19) where we discussed our goals, challenges expected and **Code Review Strategy**. We eventually settled on SonarCloud due to Jose and Jack having experience with the product. The Thursday meeting also allowed us to set our individuals goals in contributions to the assignment.

**Jack Rafter & Kyle Phipps:** Setup SonarCloud to read the python scripts, and document steps into our **Code Review Strategy**. Then analyze the returned data, and add to **Findings From Code Review**. 

**Dip Kiran Pradhan Newar & Jose Hernandez:** Setup SonarCloud to read the C & C++ scripts, and document steps into our **Code Review Strategy**. Then analyze the returned data, and add to **Findings From Code Review**. 

**Chad Middleton:** Discuss the findings with the team, determine which should be put into our **Summary of Key Findings**. 

**Full Team:** Meet and discuss our **Contributions to OpenPilot** portion. 

Our final goal was to have the document setup and finalized before our meeting with professor. Our team successfully setup our SonarCloud scanner, and documented the found CWE's as of 11/21. From here, we were then able to summarize the CWEs that we felt would best contribute to the overall security of OpenPilot, and wrote out our **Summary of Key Findings**.

As this is our final submission for the class, our team really wanted to get a head-start to give us time to breath and work through the assignment in close detail. Our communication strategy and approach in assigning roles has really helped us to a point in which we wished we had pursued this strategy earlier in the semester. To conclude, our communication, presence, and overall individual work has been excellent for this assignment.
