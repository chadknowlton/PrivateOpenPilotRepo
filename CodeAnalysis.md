# Code Analysis for Software Security Engineering
## Code Review Strategy
OpenPilot contains 1,886 files, and roughly half of them are python scripts. The rest of the files consist of a combination of bash and C, C++ files. While the use of an automated tool was with in the realm of possibility, our team felt it was necessary to first try and scan the bulk of code using an automated scanner. It is worth mentioning that OpenPilot is a massively popular project meaning that our chances of finding active vulnerbailities may be slim. However, we wanted to give an automated scanner a try to test the waters and get a feel for the vulnerbailities we should expect to see. Jose and Jack both have experience using SonarCloud and felt it was the best option in going forth to scan the Python code first. We first forked the OpenPilot repository, added a `build.yml` plugin to our builds, and developed a `sonar-project.properties` with some minor changes to fit our scan criteria. To be able to compile, we needed our 'sonar-project.properties' file to ignore all forms of C code to run properly. We did so be adding the lines `sonar.c.file.suffixes=-` , `sonar.cpp.file.suffixes=-`, and `sonar.objc.file.suffixes=-`. This netted us with 7 bugs and 182 vulnerabilities to manually check over. While we believe there are a number of false positives, our team is satisfied with the results returned.

In exploring how to analyze the C code of Openpilot, we found better success using Visual Code Grepper (VCG) instead of using Sonarcloud. Since Visual Code Grepper performs a static code analysis, it didnâ€™t require for the C files to be compiled before carrying out a scan. For this analysis tool, we downloaded the 0.8.10 release build of Openpilot and VCG version 2.2.0. Once installed, the GUI of VCG allowed us to select the target directory where the Openpilot-0.8.10 root folder was located locally on the machine, perform a full scan on it, and export the table summarizing its findings as a csv file.

In our automated scan of python scripts through SonarCloud, one concerning result returned was the use of mapped `http` addresses. This corresponds to CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. Our results suggested use to ask whether our application data transits over a network that is considered untrusted, and whether
compliance rules require the service to encrypt data in transit. Both of which we answered yes to.We recommned mapping these return functuons to `https` addresses to mitigate sensitive information being transmitted through insecure channels. 

#### athnad.py
` if r.status_code == 302 and r.headers['Location'].startswith("http://u.web2go.com"):` changed to ` if r.status_code == 302 and r.headers['Location'].startswith("https://u.web2go.com"):`

#### helpers.py
`requests.put(f'http://{host}:{port}/qlog.bz2', data='')` changed to `requests.put(f'https://{host}:{port}/qlog.bz2', data='')` and ` return func(*args, f'http://{host}:{port}', **kwargs)` to ` return func(*args, f'https://{host}:{port}', **kwargs)`


### CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Link: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html

```
    if input(msg) == 'y':
        print("Dowloading {}".format(url))
        with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response, open(tera_path, 'wb') as out_file:
            shutil.copyfileobj(response, out_file)
        print("Successfully downloaded t_renderer.")
        os.chmod(tera_path, 0o755)
        return tera_path
    msg_cancel = "\nYou cancelled automatic download.\n\n"
    msg_cancel += manual_install
    msg_cancel += "Once installed re-run your script.\n\n"
```

This CWE states that " The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors." This risk was identified as a possibility within the `utils.py` file located in `\pyextra\acados_template`. On line 181 chmod is used to assign file read/write/execute permissions to user groups, and secure coding practices specify that the most restrictive permissions possible should be assigned to files and directories. Assigning less restrictive permissions can lead to unintended access to critical resource files. 

We determined that this identified risk was relatively acceptable within Openpilot, given where the risk was identified and its implementation. The resource file in question is a tera renderer utility which lets anybody read and execute the file, but only allows for the owner to write to it. Since the file will be running in a context which is neither a multi-user environment nor does it contain any confidential  information, it is acceptable for everyone to read it.
