## Alignment with OpenPilot
In our assurance cases, we present a number of pieces of supporting evidence. For each of these pieces, we will discuss whether it aligns with functionality provided by OpenPilot.
If it does not align with OpenPilot, we will also discuss whether it might be a good candidate for inclusion in our framework with future work.
